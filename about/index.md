I'm interested in growing the attributes mentioned in my favorite Bible verse.

#### The Fruit of the Spirit -- [Gal 5:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A22-23&version=NRSV)
By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.

#### A bio 
In April 2019, I wrote this bio:

Matt Payne stumbled upon computers the summer after seventh grade.  He’s spent time as a software engineer, manager, and instructor.  He taught full time in the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Math & Computer Science department during the early and mid-1990s.   During that time he learned how gratifying it is to help people discover the fun of computer programming and especially how fun it is to help someone get a job.    These joys were one of the things that lead to Matt being named AIM’s Technology Guru of the year for 2001.   Matt is active in the Tech Omaha community and blogs at MattPayne.org.
